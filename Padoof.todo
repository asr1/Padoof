Padoof notes

## See if you can scrape from RPG Geek instead of the current place

## Remove scrape

## Remove ffmpeg

## Remove player from background.js

## Total size on disk, total number fo PDFs both showing as 0

## On video hover it should show a pdf icon instead of a play triangle, and on click should open the pdf in either a pdf reader or a system one.

## Rename files, or at least change display name.

## Page count not showing for every file.
