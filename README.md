## Requirements

Need to install GhostScript and GraphicsMagick, follow instructions [here](https://github.com/yakovmeister/pdf2image/blob/HEAD/docs/gm-installation.md). 

*I know that GraphicsMagick in particular can be a pain to install on Windows. I apologize. If I knew of an easier way to support thumbnails, I would use it. If you're struggling, look for a .exe file [here](https://sourceforge.net/projects/graphicsmagick/files/graphicsmagick-binaries/1.3.43/). There may be a more recent version available.*
